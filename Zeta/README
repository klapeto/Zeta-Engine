           Simple 2-Dimensional ARPG Engine	


===================================================
Introduction
===================================================
Zeta is a simple 2-Dimensional ARPG Engine aiming to provide developers an 
easier way to produce small to medium scale ARPG games. This is achieved by 
taking away some complex operations, like movement and collision, from the 
game developer and letting him/her work on content and GUI instead.

-------> I wouldn't recommend to anyone begin working on games right now, as the 
Documentation is not released yet. It is just a demo. The Users Manual will be 
released in the near future and then everything will be ready for development.

===================================================
How it works?
===================================================
There is the binary core where it handles the 
"difficult" stuff, and the Content where it is user defined. The developer 
creates the XML and Lua scripts and the Core "handles" them accordingly. 
The Engine's Lua Api provides some Low Level functioning too for more advanced 
programming. However if someone wants to move it even beyond, they will have 
to get to the Core sources and edit them to their needs.

===================================================
Platforms supported
===================================================
Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Linux Mint 17.1 and Fedora 21
Other ABI compatible distros should run it.

===================================================
How to build Zeta
===================================================

First of all you need to have a C++ compiler that has most c++11 features available.
  -GCC > 4.8.2 is a good one.

Make sure you have the gnu build system installed (make)

Also the following libraries installed on your system:
  -allegro5
  -lua5.1
  -zlib
  -libxml++ >2.6
  -CEGUI >8.0
  -tolua++-5.1

Most Libraries are provided by the package managers of your linux distro.
In debian-based ones, CEGUI might not be present. You need to download, build
and install it manually,

Once you have all of them, open a terminal and do the most common build process:
	
	./configure
	make -j(how many processor cores you have)   "Eg. make -j2"
	sudo make install
